Development Plan for "Task Management" Project

This document outlines the full development lifecycle of the "Task Management" project using Django Rest Framework with a focus on scalability and robust security.

---

Phase 1: Initial Setup
1. Project Initialization:
   - Create the main Django project `TaskRewardSystem`.
   - Create the `tasks` app.
   - Install required packages:
     - `djangorestframework`
     - `mysqlclient`
     - `Pillow`
     - `djangorestframework-simplejwt` (for JWT-based authentication).

2. Database Configuration:
   - Use MySQL as the database backend.
   - Set up the database connection in `settings.py`.

3. Settings Configuration:
   - Add `rest_framework`, `tasks`, and required security middleware.
   - Configure static and media files for image handling.

---

Phase 2: Authentication
1. Custom User Model:
   - Extend Django's `AbstractUser` if customization is needed.
   - Include user roles (e.g., Admin, User).

2. Authentication APIs:
   - User Signup API (validate inputs for security).
   - User Login API (JWT-based authentication).
   - Token Refresh API for session management.

---

Phase 3: Task Management
1. Task Model:
   - Fields: `image`, `name`, `description`, `created_at`, `points`, `limit`.
   - Track the maximum number of users who can claim the task.

2. Admin Task API:
   - Admin can create tasks with the necessary fields.
   - Tasks should automatically stop being displayed when the limit is reached.

3. User Task API:
   - Fetch available tasks.
   - Assign a task to the user when clicked.
   - Ensure a user cannot claim a new task without submitting the previous one.

---

Phase 4: Task Workflow
1. Task Submission API:
   - Users submit their assigned tasks for review.

2. Task Approval API:
   - Admin reviews and approves/rejects submissions.
   - On approval, points are automatically credited to the user's wallet.

---

Phase 5: Wallet Management
1. Wallet Model:
   - Track user points and the history of points earned/redeemed.

2. Wallet API:
   - Fetch wallet balance.
   - Display the history of completed tasks and earned points.

---

Phase 6: Notifications
1. Notification Model:
   - Notify users about task status changes (e.g., approval, rejection).

2. API:
   - Fetch notifications for users.

---

Phase 7: Security Enhancements
1. Authentication Security:
   - Password hashing and JWT-based authentication.
   - Two-factor authentication (optional).

2. Input Validation:
   - Sanitize and validate all API inputs.

3. Session Security:
   - Use secure cookies with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes.

4. CSRF Protection:
   - Enable CSRF tokens for all forms.

5. HTTPS:
   - Enforce HTTPS connections for all requests.

---

Phase 8: Admin Panel Customization
1. Task Management:
   - Allow the admin to view, create, and delete tasks efficiently.
2. User Management:
   - Display user history (tasks completed, points earned, etc.).

---

Deliverables
- Modular and scalable codebase.
- Complete REST APIs for authentication, tasks, wallet, and notifications.
- Secure admin panel for task and user management.
- Frontend routes (if applicable): `/admin/`, `/tasks/`, `/wallet/`, etc.
